AI agent and SaaS pricing calculator template
This "AI Pricing Strategy Designer" will walk you through the key decisions, from defining your value unit to selecting a go-to-market motion and pricing model. It culminates in a dynamic workbook where you can input your own COGS and OpEx estimates to build a complete financial picture.
This interactive tool provides a structured, step-by-step process to help you apply the strategic concepts from the report directly to your own product.

I've designed it to be a practical companion to the framework, transforming theory into an actionable plan. You can fill it out, print the summary, and use it as a foundational document for discussions with your team and potential investors.
